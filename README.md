# adapt-clifford

The MaxCut problem asks to partition an undirected graph into two disjoint subsets as to maximize the number of edges connecting nodes on different subsets. If the graph is weighted, then the goal is to maximize the sum of edge weights across the partition.

ADAPT-Clifford was introduced in [ref], as a polynomial-time quantum-inspired algorithm which finds good approximate solutions to MaxCut. This repository provides several notebooks with an implementation of the algorithm dealing with MaxCut on different graph ensembles.
In particular $K$-regular graps, Erdös-Rény graphs, and weighted complete graphs.
