# adapt-clifford

The MaxCut problem asks to partition an undirected graph into two disjoint subsets as to maximize the number of edges connecting nodes on different subsets. If the graph is weighted, then the goal is to maximize the sum of edge weights across the partition.

This repository contains a couple of notebooks solving MaxCut on different types of graphs using ADAPT-Clifford, a polynomial-time quantum-inspired algorithm introduced in [REF].
